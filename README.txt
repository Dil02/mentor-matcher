Instructions for running the project:

1. Install node from by downloading the installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Check if you have node installed by typing the commands below:
	node -v
	npm -v
	
	You should be getting something similar to v16.14.0 for node and 8.3.1 for npm

3. Go to your desired destination where you want to make the project and then run the command
	npx create-react-app mentor-matcher

4. Go to the project folder named mentor-matcher, then open the src folder, then delete the existing files
made while creating the project.

5. Extract the src.zip and copy the contents of our src folder and paste them in the new project's src folder.

6. Open a terminal/command line in the mentor-matcher folder. You can do this in Windows 10/11 by going 
back to the folder which contains the mentor-matcher directory, then Shift+Right Click on the mentor-matcher folder
and then select option: Open Command Window (or Powershell/other terminal) here.

7. In the terminal, we have to install the dependencies now. Enter the commands and press enter: 

npm install firebase
npm install react-router-dom@5.2.0
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
npm install react-firebase-hooks

This will install the React Router v5, firebase, bootstrap, and react-firebase-hooks dependencies if required by your system, as our project
uses these in order to run.

8. Then to start the development server (which will run the application), type in the following in the 
terminal: npm start

9. The previous step will open the application in your favourite browser. 
	*For the best experience, use Google Chrome 

10. Once previous step is completed, the Application is ready to use!

Thank you.
